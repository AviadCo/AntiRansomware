# AntiRansomware

## Ransomware Project (236499)

This is an application, running in Windows environment on standalone computer, which will protect the computer against Ransomware.
The application main goals are:
1.	Detect Ransomware activity on the victim's computer with minimum damage:
  a.	Detect the ransomware fast.
  b.	Stop Ransomware to continue the encryption.
  c.	Understand which files were already encrypted (if at all).
  d.	Eliminate completely the Ransomware from the victim's computer.
  
2.	Avoid alerting False-Positive â€“ the application shouldn't alert on legitimate running application.

3.	Try to restore the encrypted files.
